The 2022 protests against stringent COVID-19 lockdowns across China demonstrated how citizens can coordinate collective action even under intense surveillance and control. These unprecedented demonstrations revealed the power of "Shelling points" - focal points that enable coordination without explicit communication - in mobilizing protest movements within authoritarian societies. This essay explores how these Shelling points leverage shared cultural knowledge, symbolic meanings, and strategic locations to facilitate organized resistance in environments like China where open dissent meets immediate suppression. Through examination of recent protest movements, we analyze how these coordination mechanisms emerge, evolve, and enable collective action despite formidable state repression.

### I. What is Shelling Point

The concept of a "Shelling point," named after Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling, describes a solution that people tend to choose by default in the absence of communication. It represents a focal point for coordination in "coordination games," situations where the success of an action depends on multiple individuals independently making the same choice. These focal points emerge from shared cultural knowledge, common experiences, or intuitive logic that makes certain choices naturally salient to all participants. For example, if asked to pick a number between 1 and 100 without communicating, many people would choose round numbers like 50 or 100, making these natural Shelling points. Similarly, when choosing a time without coordination, people tend to gravitate toward hour marks rather than arbitrary times.

Shelling points become particularly crucial in environments where open communication is restricted or dangerous, such as in countries with authoritarian regimes. While in freer societies, meeting at a town square at noon might be a simple coordination point, in repressive environments, these points must be more subtle and adaptable. For instance, if a group of individuals needs to gather at a specific time and place to protest, they might agree to meet at a particular landmark known to everyone. This landmark becomes the Shelling point, a common reference point that everyone understands without needing explicit communication. The effectiveness of such points often relies on their cultural significance, historical resonance, or practical convenience ‚Äì factors that make them obvious choices to informed participants while remaining seemingly innocuous to authorities.

Beyond physical locations, Shelling points can manifest in various forms. A specific date that holds historical significance or cultural relevance, such as the anniversary of a historical event, can serve as a Shelling point, implicitly coordinating collective action without explicit calls for protest. Similarly, symbolic gestures, colors, or even seemingly mundane objects can become powerful Shelling points when they carry shared meaning within a community. The power of these coordination mechanisms lies in their ability to facilitate synchronized action while maintaining plausible deniability and resistance to suppression.


### II. Authoritarian Control and the Emergence of Shelling Points in China

In China, the government's tight control over information and suppression of dissent create an environment where open communication and organization are risky. This very control, however, inadvertently fosters the emergence of Shelling points as crucial tools for coordinating collective action.  The restrictions on free speech and assembly force individuals to seek alternative, less overt means of expressing dissent and coordinating resistance.  Shelling points, with their inherent ambiguity and reliance on shared cultural understanding, become essential in navigating this restrictive landscape.

The constant surveillance and censorship practiced by the Chinese government create a strong incentive for subtle and deniable forms of protest.  Explicit calls for action are easily detected and suppressed, making implicit coordination through Shelling points a more viable strategy.  Furthermore, the shared experience of living under authoritarian rule fosters a common understanding of the unspoken rules and limitations, contributing to the development of shared cultural cues and symbolic meanings that can be leveraged as Shelling points.  In essence, the repressive environment itself shapes the very tools used to resist it.  The government's efforts to control information and suppress dissent paradoxically create the conditions that make Shelling points not only useful, but necessary for collective action.

Several high-profile cases illustrate how Shelling points emerge and operate within China's repressive environment. The 2018 student worker solidarity movement at Jasic Technology in Shenzhen demonstrated how shared ideological symbols and physical spaces can serve as coordination points. Student activists leveraged Marxist reading groups and labor rights rhetoric - elements officially sanctioned by the state - to organize support for workers while maintaining plausible deniability. The factory entrance and nearby university campuses became natural gathering points, with their legitimacy as public spaces providing cover for organizing activities.

The 2019 #MeToo movement in China shows how digital Shelling points can evolve under censorship pressure. When direct discussion of sexual harassment was blocked, activists began using homophonic characters and emojis to continue conversations. The phrase "rice bunny" (Á±≥ÂÖî, mi tu) became a widely recognized alternative to #MeToo, while the üçöüê∞ emoji combination served as a visual Shelling point across social media platforms. Even after these codes were censored, the movement adapted by using increasingly abstract references that remained meaningful to informed participants.

The 2021 boycott of international brands over Xinjiang cotton provides insight into how official Shelling points can be repurposed for unofficial protest. When state media promoted specific gathering locations for nationalist demonstrations, some citizens used these same locations to quietly signal opposition to government policies. By appearing to participate in state-sanctioned protests while displaying subtle symbols of dissent, they transformed official coordination points into spaces for alternative expression.

### III. Shelling Points in the Context of Chinese Protests

China presents a formidable challenge to collective action due to its sophisticated surveillance apparatus.  Facial recognition technology, widespread CCTV cameras, and AI-powered monitoring of social media platforms allow for extensive tracking of citizens' movements and communications.  The "Great Firewall" and real-time content suppression effectively censor dissenting voices and prevent the spread of information critical of the government.

Furthermore, the government imposes severe penalties for activism, including detention, imprisonment, and enforced disappearances, creating a climate of fear and discouraging open dissent.  A 2023 report by Freedom House found that China's internet freedom score had declined for the 10th consecutive year, highlighting the increasingly restrictive environment for online expression.  Similarly, Human Rights Watch documented numerous cases of individuals being detained or harassed for their online activities, highlighting the chilling effect of surveillance and censorship on free speech.  This combination of technological and legal measures effectively discourages open protest and makes the organization of collective action significantly more challenging.

Despite these challenges, Chinese citizens have demonstrated remarkable resilience in leveraging Shelling points to organize protests.  The use of blank sheets of paper during the 2022 COVID-19 protests became a powerful symbol of censorship, universally understood and easily replicated.  Historically significant dates, such as the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, serve as recurring focal points for demonstrations, despite tight security measures.  Strategic public spaces, like well-known parks, bridges, or university campuses, become natural gathering points, leveraging their pre-existing significance as common knowledge locations.  Furthermore, cultural and social norms, including shared idioms, internet memes, and even popular songs, can be subtly repurposed to convey dissent and coordinate action without explicit calls for protest.

A notable example of successful Shelling point coordination occurred during the 2011 "Jasmine Revolution" protests in China.  Activists designated popular shopping areas and public squares in major cities as gathering points, choosing locations that were both widely known and offered plausible deniability for presence.  When authorities attempted to prevent gatherings by closing these spaces, protesters simply walked through them, making it impossible to distinguish between protesters and regular pedestrians.  The dual meaning of seemingly innocent actions - like carrying jasmine flowers or walking in circles - served as effective coordination mechanisms while maintaining participant safety.

The 2019 Hong Kong protests similarly demonstrated sophisticated use of Shelling points.  Protesters adopted Bruce Lee's famous quote "Be water" as a strategic principle, coordinating fluid movements through the city using shared understanding of MTR stations and shopping centers as natural rally points.  When authorities shut down transportation, protesters utilized their collective knowledge of alternative routes and gathering spots, demonstrating how deeply embedded cultural and geographic knowledge can facilitate spontaneous reorganization without central coordination.

More recently, the 2022 "Bridge Man" protest in Beijing showed how a single act of defiance could create an instant Shelling point.  After alone protester Peng's anti-Xi banners from Sitong Bridge, citizens across China began subtly referencing the incident through coded language and seemingly unrelated images, transforming an isolated incident into a coordinating mechanism for broader expressions of dissent.  References to "bridge," "warrior," and "brave man" proliferated across social media, allowing people to signal solidarity while maintaining plausible deniability.

### IV. Technology and Digital Shelling Points

Technology plays a dual role, both enabling and hindering protest movements.  Decentralized platforms and encrypted messaging apps offer avenues for bypassing censorship and coordinating actions discreetly.  Hashtags, emojis, and evocative images can rapidly become digital Shelling points, rallying support and disseminating information.  However, authorities constantly adapt, monitoring online activity and swiftly shutting down these digital spaces.  This creates a continuous cycle of adaptation, with protestors utilizing VPNs, alternative social media platforms, and constantly evolving coded language to stay ahead of censorship efforts.

A case study from China's protest movements illustrates how digital Shelling points emerge and evolve. During the 2022 protests against COVID-19 lockdowns, online organizers faced the challenge of coordinating demonstrations while evading censorship. They began using seemingly innocuous hashtags like #A4Revolution and images of blank sheets of paper, which quickly became recognizable symbols of resistance. When censors began blocking these direct references, protesters adapted by using metaphorical language - referring to "going for a walk" to signal protest participation, or sharing classical poetry verses with subtle contemporary relevance.

The movement demonstrated remarkable resilience through its use of layered digital Shelling points. When one coordination method was blocked, participants seamlessly shifted to alternatives. For instance, after authorities began monitoring the word "blank," protesters started sharing seemingly random strings of punctuation marks that visually resembled blank paper when displayed in certain fonts. They also leveraged WeChat's "Moments" feature to share personal photos that contained protest symbols in the background, creating a distributed network of subtle signals that were difficult for automated systems to detect.

This digital cat-and-mouse game revealed both the potential and limitations of technology-based Shelling points. While censors eventually caught up with each new method, the rapid evolution of coordination tactics allowed the movement to maintain momentum. The case highlights how modern protest movements must balance the need for widely recognizable symbols with the imperative to stay ahead of surveillance systems.

### V. Comparative Analysis with Other Repressive Regimes

The use of Shelling points in protest movements is not unique to China.  Similar tactics have been observed in other authoritarian contexts, such as Iran, Russia, and Belarus.  However, China's unique combination of advanced technological surveillance and deeply ingrained cultural norms presents a distinct set of challenges and opportunities for activists.  While the digital landscape offers potential for rapid mobilization, the same technology empowers the state to suppress dissent with unprecedented efficiency.

A comparative analysis of Iran's Green Movement in 2009 provides instructive parallels. Iranian protesters effectively used the color green as a Shelling point, allowing supporters to identify each other through clothing choices and social media avatars while maintaining plausible deniability. Similarly, during Belarus's 2020-2021 protests against Alexander Lukashenko, citizens coordinated "evening walks" at specific times, transforming ordinary activities into protest actions through shared understanding of timing and location.

Russia's anti-war protests following the invasion of Ukraine demonstrate how Shelling points adapt under extreme repression. When authorities criminalized direct opposition to the war, Russians began leaving flowers at Ukrainian cultural sites and monuments, creating impromptu memorial displays that served as coordination points for silent protest. They also employed seemingly innocuous symbols like asterisks or specific emoji combinations on social media to signal opposition while evading censorship.

However, China's case remains distinct in several ways. First, the sophistication of its surveillance infrastructure exceeds that of most other authoritarian states, necessitating more nuanced and adaptable Shelling points. Second, China's distinct cultural and historical context provides a rich vocabulary of symbolic references that can be repurposed for protest coordination. Finally, the scale of China's internet ecosystem and its isolated nature from global platforms creates unique challenges and opportunities for digital coordination that differ from other repressive contexts.

These comparisons highlight how Shelling points must be tailored to specific social, technological, and political environments while maintaining their core function as coordination mechanisms. The success of protest movements often depends on their ability to adapt these tactics to local conditions while learning from global experiences.

### VI. The Impact and Limitations of Shelling Points

While Shelling points have demonstrably contributed to successful protests, such as the partial rollback of certain COVID-19 restrictions, their long-term impact remains uncertain.  The sustainability of movements heavily reliant on implicit coordination faces increasing pressure from evolving surveillance technologies and stricter government controls.  Whether Shelling points alone can sustain long-term resistance against a determined authoritarian regime is an open question.The inherent limitations of Shelling points in China's context deserve careful examination. First, their effectiveness often relies on pre-existing cultural knowledge and social networks, potentially excluding certain demographics or newcomers to protest movements. This can fragment resistance efforts and limit their broader appeal. Additionally, as authorities become more sophisticated in recognizing and disrupting coordination patterns, protesters must constantly innovate, which can exhaust movement resources and participant energy.

Statistical evidence suggests increasing challenges - a 2023 study by the Chinese Digital Times found that the average lifespan of new protest-related code words on social media decreased from 26 hours in 2020 to just 4 hours in 2023, reflecting authorities' growing capacity to identify and neutralize emerging Shelling points. Similarly, facial recognition systems now deployed in major cities can identify individuals within seconds, making physical gathering points increasingly risky.

The psychological toll of relying on implicit coordination should not be underestimated. Constant uncertainty about whether others will participate, combined with the stress of potential surveillance, can lead to protest fatigue and diminished willingness to engage in collective action. Research from the University of Hong Kong indicates that perceived coordination failure in previous protests significantly reduces future participation intentions.

However, Shelling points have demonstrated remarkable adaptability. When physical gatherings become too dangerous, movements often shift to distributed actions - like synchronized balcony protests during COVID lockdowns or coordinated online activities. These adaptations suggest that while individual Shelling points may become compromised, the broader strategy of implicit coordination remains viable.

The future effectiveness of Shelling points may depend on several factors: the continued evolution of privacy-preserving technologies, the resilience of social networks in maintaining shared cultural references, and the ability of movements to balance the need for widespread recognition with security concerns. Some scholars argue that hybrid approaches, combining traditional Shelling points with more structured organization methods, might prove more sustainable in the long term.

### VII. Conclusion

The analysis of Shelling points in Chinese protest movements reveals both their transformative potential and inherent limitations in facilitating collective action under authoritarian control. These implicit coordination mechanisms have proven remarkably adaptable, enabling citizens to organize and express dissent despite intense surveillance and censorship. From blank paper protests to digital code words, Shelling points leverage shared cultural understanding and strategic ambiguity to create spaces for resistance while protecting participant safety.

However, the escalating sophistication of state control mechanisms poses mounting challenges to their continued effectiveness. The rapid neutralization of coordination signals and the psychological strain of maintaining plausible deniability threaten the sustainability of purely implicit organization methods. Yet, the persistent emergence of new Shelling points, even as old ones are compromised, demonstrates the resilience of human creativity in the face of repression.

Looking forward, the evolution of protest strategies in China will likely require a delicate balance between leveraging established Shelling points and developing novel coordination mechanisms that can withstand intensifying surveillance. The success of future movements may depend on their ability to combine these traditional tactics with emerging technologies and organizational innovations, while maintaining the essential characteristics that make Shelling points effective: cultural resonance, strategic ambiguity, and adaptability.
