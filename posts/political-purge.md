Communist regimes—especially those with authoritarian structures—often need a scapegoat to explain policy failures while preserving the legitimacy of the ruling party. Since these regimes typically claim to represent the "will of the people" and the "correct" ideological path, admitting failure outright would undermine their authority. Here’s why the need for an internal or external "enemy" often drives purges:

### **1. Justifying Policy Failures Without Blaming the System**
   - Communist regimes operate on the premise that their ideology (Marxism-Leninism, Maoism, etc.) is scientifically correct and destined to succeed.
   - When policies fail—such as forced collectivization, economic mismanagement, or unpopular reforms—blaming the system would contradict this claim.
   - Instead, the failure is attributed to "saboteurs," "counter-revolutionaries," or "corrupt elements" within the party.

   **Example:**  
   - Stalin blamed "kulaks" and "wreckers" for the disastrous famine caused by forced collectivization (1930s).  
   - Mao blamed "capitalist roaders" for the economic disasters of the Great Leap Forward (1958-1962), rather than acknowledging policy mistakes.

### **2. Creating a Climate of Fear & Strengthening Party Unity**
   - By constantly identifying enemies, the party forces members to remain loyal and suppress dissent.
   - Party members must actively demonstrate loyalty—often by denouncing colleagues or taking part in purges—to avoid suspicion.
   - This eliminates independent thinking and ensures that the party remains a monolithic, obedient structure.

   **Example:**  
   - During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), Mao encouraged young Red Guards to purge officials and intellectuals accused of being "bourgeois reactionaries."
   - The fear of being labeled an enemy of the revolution kept people in line.

### **3. Maintaining Revolutionary Momentum**
   - Communist regimes rely on the idea of "continuous revolution" to justify their rule.
   - Even after consolidating power, they must maintain the narrative that the revolution is under threat.
   - By regularly purging "hidden enemies," the party presents itself as actively defending the people from internal threats.

   **Example:**  
   - The Soviet Union under Khrushchev denounced Stalin-era crimes but still purged "anti-party elements" to show the revolution was ongoing.
   - Xi Jinping’s "anti-corruption campaign" has removed thousands of officials, but critics argue it's also a way to eliminate political opponents while reinforcing party discipline.

### **4. Deflecting Blame to Protect the Leadership**
   - When policies fail, leaders use purges to shift responsibility away from themselves.
   - Instead of acknowledging flawed decisions, they accuse certain individuals or groups of "sabotaging" progress.
   - This allows the leadership to maintain credibility while removing inconvenient figures.

   **Example:**  
   - After the failure of the Great Leap Forward, Mao stepped back temporarily, and Liu Shaoqi (a more pragmatic leader) took over economic management.
   - But when Liu’s market-oriented reforms showed signs of success, Mao labeled him a "capitalist roader" and purged him during the Cultural Revolution.

### **5. Adapting & Strengthening Control During Crises**
   - In times of economic downturn, international pressure, or public unrest, regimes intensify purges to reinforce their control.
   - Blaming an "enemy" (whether internal or external) can rally public support around the leadership.
   - The purge serves as a way to reassure citizens that the party is "cleaning house" and fighting corruption or sabotage.

   **Example:**  
   - In modern China, Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption purges have targeted rivals and critics under the guise of party discipline.
   - This serves a dual purpose: appearing to tackle corruption while consolidating power.

### **Conclusion: A Survival Tactic**
The need for an "enemy" to justify policy failures is a core reason for repeated purges in communist regimes. It prevents the party from admitting mistakes, keeps the elite in check, and reinforces the idea that the party is always fighting for the people. However, excessive purges can also destabilize a regime—if too many officials are purged, governance suffers, as seen in Stalin’s USSR or Mao’s China. The key to survival is managing these purges carefully, using them to strengthen control without undermining the state’s functionality.
